# Mini-libc

## Objectives

- Learn about the structure and functionalities provided by the standard C library
- Accommodate with the syscall interface in Linux
- Gain a better understanding of strings and memory management functions
- Learn how the standard C library provides support for low-level input/output operations

## Statement

Build a **minimalistic** [**standard C library**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) implementation for Linux systems (named **mini-libc**), that can be used as a replacement for the **system libc** ([glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) in Linux).
The goal is to have a minimally functional libc with features such as string management, basic memory support and POSIX file I/O.
